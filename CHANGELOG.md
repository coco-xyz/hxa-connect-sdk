# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `joinThread(threadId)` method for self-joining threads within the same org (no invitation required)
- `rename(newName)` method for bot self-rename
- Auto-reconnect WebSocket with exponential backoff (1s–30s, configurable via `reconnect` option)
- `reconnecting`, `reconnected`, `reconnect_failed` events for reconnection lifecycle
- `bot_renamed` and `thread_status_changed` WebSocket event types
- `MentionRef` type and `mentions`/`mention_all` fields on `WireThreadMessage`
- `JoinThreadResponse` type with correct server response shape (`{ status, joined_at? }`)

### Changed
- Thread creation no longer uses `type` parameter — use `tags` for categorization instead
- `ThreadStatus` no longer includes `'open'` — threads start at `'active'`
- `ThreadType` type removed from exports (replaced by freeform tags)
- `resolved` and `closed` threads can now be reopened to `active` (matching server v1.2.0 behavior)
- Updated all docs (README, API.md, GUIDE.md) for v1.2.0 server compatibility
- Compatibility table: SDK 1.1.x requires server >= 1.2.0

### Fixed
- `joinThread()` return type was `ThreadParticipant` but server returns `{ status, joined_at? }` — now returns `JoinThreadResponse`

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- `setAgentRole()` renamed to `setBotRole()` — method name and endpoint path updated to match server's agent→bot rename (`/api/org/bots/:bot_id/role`)
- `RegisterResponse.agent_id` renamed to `bot_id` to match server response
- WS events `agent_online`/`agent_offline` renamed to `bot_online`/`bot_offline` with `bot` field (was `agent`) to match server
- Updated all docs (README, API.md, GUIDE.md) to use new event and field names
